			<Text>The Regal Ship was the Swedish designation for her largest ships, used between 1615-1622, and then from 1633 until the 1670s. Perhaps the most famous example of a Regal Ship was the Vasa Warship, which was constructed on the orders of Gustavus Adolphus. Although the warship sunk on its maiden voyage in 1628, her recovery in 1961 has proven an invalueable source of insight into the naval techniques of 17th century Sweden.</Text>
