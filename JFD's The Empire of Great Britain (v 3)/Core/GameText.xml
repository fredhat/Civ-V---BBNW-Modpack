			<Text>Victoria served as English monarch for 64 years - the longest reign in English history. She took the throne at 18, after the death of her uncle, King William IV. At 20 she married Prince Albert, to whom she bore nine children. The couple was very much in love and co-ruled for twenty years. She and Albert were quite interested in science, and in 1851 they inspired the hugely successful Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace, the proceeds going to establish a number of public museums, including the Albert and Victoria museum; which remains one of the world's finest museums even today.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the early years of her reign Victoria was a quite active monarch, and she won the hearts of her people with her modesty and practicality. It was during this period that she performed her greatest service to the British people: she oversaw the transition of the British throne to a constitutional monarchy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Albert died in 1861, Victoria was devastated. She went into permanent mourning, retiring from the day-to-day rule of her country and secluding herself on the Isle of Wight, where she was increasingly involved in somewhat dubious spiritual exploration. Her self-pity was legendary - a remarkable change from her youthful modesty and enthusiasm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Victoria's isolation and indifference to the management of her country left room for extremely talented prime ministers, such as Gladstone and Disraeli, to guide Great Britain into a golden age of prosperity and expansion. During this period the Empire came to dominate half of the world's area and population - including India and much of the Orient, as well as large chunks of Africa, Asia, North America and a goodly portion of the Pacific islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Victoria believed that Great Britain had a mandate from heaven to bring the ignorant peoples of the world beneath the protection of the British flag. She felt that she personally had a duty to these untutored people, to educate and clothe them, and most importantly, to bring them to the church.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During her reign, Great Britain grew from a moderate European power into the greatest empire the world has ever known, an Empire on which "the sun never set," far overshadowing Imperial Rome in size and might. The Diamond Jubilee, celebrating Victoria's 60th year as monarch, dwarfed in pomp and majesty anything that a puny Caesar could have ever mustered.</Text>

			<Text>By the Grace of God, we bow in humble servitude to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, sovereign and protector of the glorious British Empire! Taking the throne at 18, you would serve Great Britain as her longest and most prestigious monarch, overseeing the spread of its imperial might across the globe, and its rapid transformation into an industrial giant. Under the mandate of God, the British Empire would come to dominate all corners of the earth, bringing great wealth and glory to her heart, and a plethora of new ideas to the traditional world. As her Queen, you would retain dignity and modesty and grave composure, and you would embolden the fondness of your subjects for their Monarchy, leaving behind you an age of resounding greatness that would serve to remind its descendants of the fiery will of the British Isles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most gracious Queen, long has Great Britain yearned for the power and wealth that it once knew. Can you bear your duty as sovereign of the empire where the sun is forever shining? Can you bring civilization to the barbarous peoples of the earth and with it glory and greatness for the hearts of your subjects? Can you build a civilization that stands the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>The rating system of the Royal Navy and its predecessors was used by the British Royal Navy between the beginning of the 17th century and the middle of the 19th century to categorise sailing warships, initially classing them according to their assigned complement of men, and later according to the number of their carriage-mounted guns. The first movement towards a rating system may be seen in the 15th century and the first half of the 16th century, when the largest carracks in the Navy (such as the Mary Rose, the Peter Pomegranate and the Henri Grâce à Dieu) were denoted "great ships". This was only on the basis of their roughly-estimated size and not on their weight, crew or number of guns. When these carracks were superseded by the new-style galleons later in the 16th century, the term "great ship" was used to formally delineate the Navy's largest ships from all the rest.</Text>
