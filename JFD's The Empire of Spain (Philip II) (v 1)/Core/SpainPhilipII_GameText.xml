			<Text>Philip II was King of Spain, King of Portugal, King of Naples and Sicily, and during his marriage to Queen Mary I, was King of England and Ireland. He was also Duke of Milan. From 1555, he was lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Known in Spain as "Felipe el Prudente" ('"Philip the Prudent'"), his empire included territories on every continent then known to Europeans, including his namesake the Philippine Islands. During his reign, Spain reached the height of its influence and power. This is sometimes called the Golden Age. The expression, "the empire on which the sun never sets," was coined during Philip's time to reflect the extent of his dominion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Philip's reign there were separate state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1569, 1575, and 1596. This was partly the cause for the declaration of independence which created the Dutch Republic in 1581. A devout Catholic, Philip is also known for organising a huge naval expedition against Protestant England in 1588, known usually as the Spanish Armada, which was unsuccessful, mostly due to storms and grave logistical problems.</Text>

			<Text>Under Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power. However, in spite of the great and increasing quantities of gold and silver flowing into his coffers from the American mines, the riches of the Portuguese spice trade, and the enthusiastic support of the Habsburg dominions for the Counter-Reformation, he would never succeed in suppressing Protestantism or defeating the Dutch rebellion. Early in his reign, the Dutch might have laid down their weapons if he had desisted in trying to suppress Protestantism, but his devotion to Catholicism would not permit him to do so. He was a devout Catholic and exhibited the typical 16th century disdain for religious heterodoxy; he said, "Before suffering the slightest damage to religion in the service of God, I would lose all of my estates and a hundred lives, if I had them, because I do not wish nor do I desire to be the ruler of heretics."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The defeat of Protestantism was always keen in Philip's mind. For a while, he ruled England jointly with Queen Mary Tudor and a reconciliation with the Catholic Church followed. Heresy trials were reestablished and hundreds of Protestants burned at the stake. England and Philip parted ways after the death of his Queen, nicknamed "Bloody Mary". Philip's gravest mistake over the long run was his attempt to violently eradicate Protestantism from the Netherlands which was a major economic asset for the empire. Under harsh occupation, the Dutch finally rebelled and wrested independence after an eighty-year war, the strain of which did Philip's realm little good. His greatest battlefield accomplishment was the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at Lepanto which turned the tide against Turkish aggression.</Text>

			<Text>Philip II, by the Grace of God, His Catholic Majesty, and King of Spain, welcome. Beneath your rule, the Spanish empire would reach its greatest height. Stretching from the Americas in the West to your namesake, the Philippines, in the East, Spain would become the pre-eminent power of the 16th century. Indeed, through your inheritance of the Habsburg lands in Europe and your marriage to Mary, Queen of England, you would become the most powerful monarch that Europe had seen since Charlemagne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Illustrious King, the greatest task falls upon you - to rise to the challenge and command an empire upon which the sun never sets. Can you, in the name of God and the Holy Mother Church, diffuse Spain's forces across the earth? Can you bring prosperity and faith to the darkest corners of your empire? Can you build a civilization that can stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>A seminary, theological college, or divinity school is an educational institution for educating students (sometimes called seminarians) in theology, generally to prepare them for ordination as clergy or for other ministry. The establishment of modern seminaries resulted from Roman Catholic reforms of the Counter-Reformation after the Council of Trent. The Tridentine seminaries placed great emphasis on personal discipline as well as the teaching of philosophy as a preparation for theology.</Text>
