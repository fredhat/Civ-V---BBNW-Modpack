			<Text>The Kingdom of Prussia begins with the conquest of the Old Prussians by the Teutonic Knights, a devout military order devoted to the spread of Catholicism and the suppression of paganism, who would found the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order. A conflict between the Teutons and the Kingdom of Poland would see Prussia divided in 1466 into Royal Prussia, to become a province of Poland, and the Duchy of Prussia, to become a fief to the Crown of Poland. Prussia would remain divided until 1618, when it would unionise with the Magraviate of Bradenburg, an important Principality within the Holy Roman Empire, which would thus conceive the Kingdom of Prussia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Kingdom would grow into a great power during the 18th and 19th centuries, especially so under the reign of King Frederick the Great, and would establish for itself a reputation for its exceptional military. Following the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire, Prussia would be allocated by the Congress of Vienna a large section of North-Western Germany, and subsequently would grow into the North German Confederation. This Confederation would become the German Empire in 1871 and the Prussian identity would be supplanted by that of a German one. The Kingdom would formally come to an end in the early 20th century.</Text>

			<Text>Honour to you, oh brilliant and tactful Frederick the Great. You are the King of Prussia, a state conceived of piety and bloodshed, but elevated to the heights of power by her exceptional capability on the battlefield. Celebrated for your military genius, your victories against Austria and Poland would win Prussia the military acclaim of her legacy, extending the reach of her territory into Silesia, and firmly establishing her place amongst the great powers of Europe. A proponent of enlightened absolutism, a patron of the arts and a friend of the writer-philosopher Voltaire, you would bring Prussia into modernity, bestowing religious freedom and enlightenment to your people, and dawning upon your Kingdom a magnificent golden age unseen before.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most supreme and enlightened King, the days of Prussia's military glory thunders in the distance. Can you lead your armies into battle? To march your soldiers against all manner of foe and to come from war triumphant? Can you uphold the power and liberties beheld by your Crown? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_JFD_FREDERICK_TEXT_1">
			<Text>Frederick was born to Frederick William I, the tyrannical and cultured King of Prussia. The king held his son in great contempt, despising him for his lack of interest in leadership and war; the younger Frederick instead preferred to study literature and the arts. At the age of 18 Frederick attempted to flee to England, but he was captured and brought back to his extremely angry father, who forced him to watch the beheading of his close friend and accomplice, Lieutenant Katz. He apparently was able to get back into his father's good graces, and several years later he married a German noblewoman at his father's request.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the next several years Frederick enjoyed the life of a wealthy man of letters. He maintained an active correspondence with various scholars from around Europe, including the brilliant French writer; Voltaire. He wrote "Anti-Machiavel," a lively refutation of Machiavelli's; "The Prince." Frederick assumed the throne of Prussia upon his father's death in 1740. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once in power, Frederick showed himself to be both a ruthless pragmatist and a brilliant campaigner. Seeking to increase the size of his empire, over the next 23 years he fought a series of wars against his neighbors, notably Austria, who was often allied with Russia and France. With the support of England he won a series of significant battles against his foes, but he was eventually worn down and soundly defeated, and Berlin was occupied by an allied Austrian-Russian army. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Reportedly on the verge of suicide, Frederick was saved by the timely death of the Russian Tsarina, who was replaced by the pro-Prussian Peter III. Facing the combined power of Russia and Prussia, Austria was forced to accede to Frederick's demands and give up all claims to Upper and Lower Silesia. The two European monarchs then dismembered Poland, making Prussia the most powerful force in Europe for many years to come. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Domestically, Frederick was the model of an "enlightened despot." He instituted important legal and penal reforms, created new industries, improved education, and accomplished internal improvements such as drainage projects, roads, and canals. He improved the lot of his own serfs (but did nothing to curtail the nobility's power over them).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During his rule Frederick maintained his friendship with the enlightened men of Europe. His midnight soirees in Potsdam were famous for the great men they attracted. Frederick was quite famous for his sharp wit and caustic tongue; he more than held his own in their company.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Frederick died in 1786, leaving Prussia more powerful and prosperous than when he first gained power. Upon his death, Frederick's nephew Frederick William II inherited the throne of Prussia.</Text>
